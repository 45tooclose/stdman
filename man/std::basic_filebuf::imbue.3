.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   virtual void imbue( const std::locale& loc )

   Changes the associated locale so that all characters inserted or extracted after
   this call (and until another call to imbue()) are converted using the std::codecvt
   facet of loc.

   If the old locale's encoding is state-dependent and file is not positioned at the
   beginning, then the new locale must have the same std::codecvt facet as the one
   previously imbued.

.SH Parameters

   loc - the locale to imbue the stream with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP
