   ~future();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Releases any shared state. This means

     * if the return object or provider holds the last reference to its shared state,
       the shared state is destroyed; and
     * the return object or provider gives up its reference to its shared state; and
     * these actions will not block for the shared state to become ready, except that
       it may block if all of the following are true: the shared state was created by a
       call to std::async, the shared state is not yet ready, and this was the last
       reference to the shared state.
