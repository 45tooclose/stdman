.SH Synopsis
   template< class U >                        (library fundamentals TS)
   constexpr T value_or( U&& value ) const&;
   template< class U >                        (library fundamentals TS)
   T value_or( U&& value ) &&;

   Returns the contained value if *this is in engaged state, otherwise returns value.

.SH Parameters

   value                  -                  the value to exchange
.SH Type requirements
   -
   T must meet the requirements of CopyConstructible in order to use overload \fB(1)\fP.
   -
   T must meet the requirements of MoveConstructible in order to use overload \fB(2)\fP.
   -
   U&& must be convertible to T

.SH Return value

   The current value if *this is in engaged state, or value otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

   Any exception thrown by the selected constructor of T.

   If an exception is thrown, the exception safety guarantee is as follows:

     * If *this was in engaged state, the contents of the contained value depend on the
       exception safety guarantee of T's constructor.
     * Otherwise, the state of *this does not change. The contents of value depend on
       the exception safety guarantee of T's constructor.
