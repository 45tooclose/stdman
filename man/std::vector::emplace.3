.TH std::vector::emplace 3 "Nov 25 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::vector::emplace \- std::vector::emplace

.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >                                \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator emplace( const_iterator pos, Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element into the container directly before pos. The element is
   constructed in-place, i.e. no copy or move operations are performed. The constructor
   of the element is called with the arguments std::forward<Args>(args).... The element
   type must be EmplaceConstructible, MoveInsertable and MoveAssignable.

   If the new size() is greater than capacity(), all iterators and references are
   invalidated. Otherwise, only the iterators and references before the insertion point
   remain valid. The past-the-end iterator is also invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   pos  - iterator before which the new element will be constructed
   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   Iterator pointing to the emplaced element.

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the distance between pos and end of the container.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown (e.g. by the constructor), the container is left
   unmodified, as if this function was never called \fI(strong exception guarantee)\fP.

.SH Notes

   The specialization std::vector<bool> did not have emplace() member until C++14.
