   Destructs the container. The destructors of the elements are called and the used
   storage is deallocated. Note, that if the elements are pointers, the pointed-to
   objects are not destroyed. The global operator delete is called only if the operator
   new was called during construction

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the size of the container.
