   Compares the underlying std::type_info objects.

   1-2) Checks whether the underlying std::type_info objects refer to the same type.

   3-6) Compares the underlying std::type_info objects as defined by an
   implementation-defined ordering. The comparison is done by type_info::before.

.SH Parameters

   rhs - another type_index object to compare to

.SH Return value

   1) true if the underlying std::type_info objects refer to the same type, false
   otherwise

   2) true if the underlying std::type_info objects refer not to the same type, false
   otherwise

   3-6) true if the types referred by the underlying std::type_info objects are ordered
   by corresponding order, false otherwise.
