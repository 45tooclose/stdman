.SH Synopsis
   template< class T, class Container, class Alloc >

   struct uses_allocator<stack<T,Container>,Alloc> :  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   std::uses_allocator<Container, Alloc>::type { };

   Provides a transparent specialization of the std::uses_allocator type trait for
   std::stack: the container adaptor uses allocator if and only if the underlying
   container does.
