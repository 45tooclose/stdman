   Constructs new pseudo-random engine adaptor.

   1) Default constructor. The underlying engine is also default-constructed.
   2) Constructs the underlying engine with seed sequence seq.
   3) Constructs the underlying engine with a copy of e.
   4) Move-constructs the underlying engine with e. e holds unspecified, but valid
   state afterwards.

.SH Parameters

   seq - seed sequence to construct the underlying engine with
   e   - pseudo-random number engine to initialize with
