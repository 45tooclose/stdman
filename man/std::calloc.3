.TH std::calloc 3 "Nov 25 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::calloc \- std::calloc

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   void* calloc( std::size_t num, std::size_t size );

   Allocates memory for an array of num objects of size size and zero-initializes it.

   If allocation succeeds, returns a pointer to the lowest (first) byte in the
   allocated memory block that is suitably aligned for any object type.

   If size is zero, the behavior is implementation defined (null pointer may be
   returned, or some non-null pointer may be returned that may not be used to access
   storage)

.SH Parameters

   num  - number of objects
   size - size of each object

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the beginning of newly allocated memory or NULL if error has occurred.
   The pointer must be deallocated with free().

.SH Notes

   Due to the alignment requirements, the number of allocated bytes is not necessarily
   equal to num*size.
