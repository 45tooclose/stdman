   Replaces the contents of the string.

   1) Replaces the contents with a copy of str

   2) Replaces the contents with those of str using move semantics. str is in undefined
   state after the operation.

   3) Replaces the contents with those of null-terminated character string pointed to
   by s.

   4) Replaces the contents with character ch

   8) Replaces the contents with those of the initializer list ilist.

.SH Parameters

   ch   - value to initialize characters of the string with
   str  - string to be used as source to initialize the string with
   s    - pointer to a null-termanated character string
          to use as source to initialize the string with
   init - initializer list to initialize the string with

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Complexity

   1) linear in size of str

   2) constant. If alloc is given and alloc != other.get_allocator(), then linear.

   3) linear in size of s

   4) constant.

   5) linear in size of init

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong
   exception guarantee).
   \fI(since C++11)\fP

   If the operation would result in size() > max_size(), throws std::length_error.
