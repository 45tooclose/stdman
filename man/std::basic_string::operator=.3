   Replaces the contents of the string.

   1) Replaces the contents with a copy of str. If *this and str are the same object,
   this function has no effect.
   2) Replaces the contents with those of str using move semantics. Leaves str in
   valid, but unspecified state. If *this and str are the same object,
   the function has no effect
   \fI(until C++17)\fP
   the behavior is undefined
   \fI(since C++17)\fP.
   3) Replaces the contents with those of null-terminated character string pointed to
   by s as if by *this = basic_string(s), which involves a call to Traits::length(s).
   4) Replaces the contents with character ch as if by *this = basic_string(1,c)
   5) Replaces the contents with those of the initializer list ilist as if by *this =
   basic_string(ilist)

.SH Parameters

   ch   - value to initialize characters of the string with
   str  - string to be used as source to initialize the string with
   s    - pointer to a null-terminated character string
          to use as source to initialize the string with
   init - initializer list to initialize the string with

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Complexity

   1) linear in size of str

   2) constant. If alloc is given and alloc != other.get_allocator(), then linear.

   3) linear in size of s

   4) constant.

   5) linear in size of init

.SH Exceptions

   2)
   noexcept specification:   \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept                  \fI(until C++17)\fP
     

   If the operation would result in size() > max_size(), throws std::length_error.

   If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   \fI(strong exception guarantee)\fP.
