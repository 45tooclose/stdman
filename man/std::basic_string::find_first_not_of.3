.SH Synopsis
   size_type find_first_not_of( const basic_string& str, size_type pos = 0 )       \fB(1)\fP
   const;
   size_type find_first_not_of( const CharT* s, size_type pos, size_type count )   \fB(2)\fP
   const;
   size_type find_first_not_of( const CharT* s, size_type pos = 0 ) const;         \fB(3)\fP
   size_type find_first_not_of( CharT ch, size_type pos = 0 ) const;               \fB(4)\fP

   Finds the first character equal to none of the characters in the given character
   sequence. Search begins at pos, i.e. the found character must not be in position
   preceding pos.

   1) Finds the first character equal to none of characters in str.
   2) Finds the first character equal to none of characters in the first count
   characters of the character string pointed to by s. s can include null characters.
   3) Finds the first character equal to none of characters in character string pointed
   to by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null character.
   4) Finds the first character not equal to ch.

.SH Parameters

   str   - string identifying characters to search for
   pos   - position for the seach to start from
   count - length of character string identifying characters to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string identifying characters to search for
   ch    - character identifying characters to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the found character or npos if no such character is found.

.SH Exceptions

.SH Notes

   These functions use traits::eq() to test the characters for equality.
