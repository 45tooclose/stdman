   Inserts elements at specified location in the container.

   1-2) inserts value before the location pointed to by pos
   3) inserts count copies of the value before the location pointed to by pos
   4) inserts elements from range [first, last) before the location pointed to by pos.
   The behavior is undefined if first and last are iterators into *this.
   5) inserts elements from initializer list ilist.

   All iterators, including the past-the-end iterator, are invalidated. References are
   invalidated too, unless pos == begin() or pos == end(), in which case they are not
   invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   pos         - iterator to the location before which the content will be inserted.
                 pos may be the end() iterator
   value       - element value to insert
   first, last - the range of elements to insert, can't be iterators into container for
                 which insert is called
   ilist       - initializer list to insert the values from
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of InputIterator.

.SH Return value

   1-2) Iterator pointing to the inserted value
   3) Iterator pointing to the first element inserted, or pos if count==0.
   4) Iterator pointing to the first element inserted, or pos if first==last.
   5) Iterator pointing to the first element inserted, or pos if ilist is empty.

.SH Complexity

   1-2) Constant plus linear in the lesser of the distances between pos and either of
   the ends of the container.
   3) Linear in count plus linear in the lesser of the distances between pos and either
   of the ends of the container.
   4) Linear in std::distance(first, last) plus linear in the lesser of the distances
   between pos and either of the ends of the container.
   5) Linear in ilist.size() plus linear in the lesser of the distances between pos and
   either of the ends of the container.
