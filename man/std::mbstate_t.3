.TH std::mbstate_t 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   struct mbstate_t;

   The type mbstate_t is a trivial non-array type that can represent any of the
   conversion states that can occur in an implementation-defined set of supported
   multibyte character encoding rules. Zero-initialized value of mbstate_t represents
   the initial conversion state, although other values of mbstate_t may exist that also
   represent the initial conversion state.

   Possible implementation of mbstate_t is a struct type holding an array representing
   the incomplete multibyte character, an integer counter indicating the number of
   bytes in the array that have been processed, and a representation of the current
   shift state.

   The following functions should not be called from multiple threads without
   synchronization with the std::mbstate_t* argument of NULL due to possible data
   races: std::mbrlen, std::mbrtowc, std::mbsrtowc, std::mbtowc, std::wcrtomb,
   std::wcsrtomb, std::wctomb.
