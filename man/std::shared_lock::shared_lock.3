   Constructs a shared_lock, optionally locking the supplied mutex.

   1) Constructs a shared_lock with no associated mutex.
   2) Move constructor. Initializes the shared_lock with the contents of other. Leaves
   other with no associated mutex.
   3-8) Constructs a shared_lock with m as the associated mutex. Additionally:
   3) Locks the associated mutex in shared mode by calling m.lock_shared(). The
   behavior is undefined if this thread already owns the mutex in any mode.
   4) Does not lock the associated mutex.
   5) Tries to lock the associated mutexin shared mode without blocking by calling
   m.try_lock_shared(). The behavior is undefined if this thread already owns the mutex
   in any mode.
   5) Assumes the calling thread already owns m in shared mode.
   7) Tries to lock the associated mutex in shared mode by calling
   m.try_lock_shared_until(timeout_duration), which blocks until specified
   timeout_duration has elapsed or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. May
   block for longer than timeout_duration. The behavior is undefined if this thread
   already owns the mutex in any mode.
   8) Tries to lock the associated mutex in shared mode by calling
   m.try_lock_shared_for(timeout_time), which blocks until specified timeout_time has
   been reached or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. May block for longer
   than until timeout_time has been reached. The behavior is undefined if this thread
   already owns the mutex in any mode.

.SH Parameters

   other            - another shared_lock to initialize the state with
   m                - mutex to associate with the lock and optionally acquire ownership
                      of
   t                - tag parameter used to select constructors with different locking
                      strategies
   timeout_duration - maximum duration to block for
   timeout_time     - maximum time point to block until
