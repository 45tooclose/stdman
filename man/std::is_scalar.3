.TH std::is_scalar 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <type_traits>
   template< class T >              \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_scalar;

   If T is a scalar type (that is, arithmetic type, enumeration type, pointer, pointer
   to member, or std::nullptr_t, including any cv-qualified variants), provides the
   member constant value equal true. For any other type, value is false.

   value_type bool
   type       std::integral_constant<bool, value>

.SH Notes

   Each individual memory location in the C++ memory model, including the hidden memory
   locations used by language features (e.g virtual table pointer), has scalar type (or
   is a sequence of adjacent bit-fields of non-zero length). Sequencing of side-effects
   in expression evaluation, interthread synchronization, and dependency ordering are
   all defined in terms of individual scalar objects.

.SH Possible implementation

template< class T >
struct is_scalar : std::integral_constant<bool,
                     std::is_arithmetic<T>::value     ||
                     std::is_enum<T>::value           ||
                     std::is_pointer<T>::value        ||
                     std::is_member_pointer<T>::value ||
                     std::is_same<std::nullptr_t, typename std::remove_cv<T>::type>::value> {};

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <type_traits>
  
 int main() {
     class cls {};
     std::cout << (std::is_scalar<int>::value
                      ? "T is scalar"
                      : "T is not a scalar") << '\\n';
     std::cout << (std::is_scalar<cls>::value
                      ? "T is scalar"
                      : "T is not a scalar") << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 T is scalar
 T is not a scalar
