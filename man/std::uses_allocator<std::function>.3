.TH std::uses_allocator<std::function> 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   template< class R, class... ArgTypes, class Alloc >
   struct uses_allocator<std::function<R(ArgTypes...)>, Alloc> :          \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::true_type { };

   This specialization of std::uses_allocator informs other library components that all
   objects of type std::function support uses-allocator construction, even though they
   do not have a nested allocator_type.
