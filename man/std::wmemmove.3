.TH std::wmemmove 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   wchar_t* wmemmove( wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, std::size_t count );

   Copies count wide characters from the object pointed to by src to the object pointed
   to by dest. The objects may overlap: copying takes place as if the characters were
   copied to a temporary character array and then the characters were copied from the
   array to dest. If the objects are not trivially-copyable (scalars, arrays, C-style
   structs), the behavior is undefined.
