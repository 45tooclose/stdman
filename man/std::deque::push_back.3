.SH NAME
std::deque::push_back \- std::deque::push_back

.SH Synopsis
   void push_back( const T& value ); \fB(1)\fP
   void push_back( T&& value );      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Appends the given element value to the end of the container.

   1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.
   2) value is moved into the new element.

   All iterators, including the past-the-end iterator, are invalidated. No references
   are invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   value             -            the value of the element to append
.SH Type requirements
   -
   T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload \fB(1)\fP.
   -
   T must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable in order to use overload \fB(2)\fP.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown, this function has no effect \fI(strong exception guarantee)\fP.

.SH Example

   The following code uses push_back to add several integers to a std::deque<int>:

   
// Run this code

 #include <deque>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::deque<int> numbers;
  
     numbers.push_back(42);
     numbers.push_back(314159);
  
     for (int i : numbers) { // c++11 range-based for loop
         std::cout << i << '\\n';
     }
  
     return 0;
 }

.SH Output:

 42
 314159
