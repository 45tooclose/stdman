.TH std::is_placeholder 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   template< class T >             \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_placeholder;

   If T is the type of a standard placeholder (_1, _2, _3, ...), then this template is
   derived from std::integral_constant<int,1>, std::integral_constant<int,2>,
   std::integral_constant<int,3>, respectively. If T is not a standard placeholder
   type, this template is derived from std::integral_constant<int,0>.

   The template may be specialized for any user-defined type which should be treated by
   std::bind as if it was a placeholder for unbound arguments.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <type_traits>
 #include <functional>

 struct My_2 {
 } my_2;

 namespace std {
     template<>
     struct is_placeholder<My_2> : public integral_constant<int, 2> {};
 }

 int f(int n1, int n2)
 {
     return n1+n2;
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::cout << "Standard placeholder _5 is for the argument number "
               << std::is_placeholder<decltype(std::placeholders::_5)>::value
               << '\\n';

     auto b = std::bind(f, my_2, 2);
     std::cout << "Adding 2 to 11 selected with a custom placeholder gives "
               << b(10, 11)
               << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Standard placeholder _5 is for the argument number 5
 Adding 2 to 11 selected with a custom placeholder gives 13
