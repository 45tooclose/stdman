.SH NAME
std::experimental::shared_future::shared_future \- std::experimental::shared_future::shared_future

.SH Synopsis
   shared_future(future<shared_future<T>> && other);

   Constructs a shared_future object from the shared state referred to by other. The
   resulting shared_future object becomes ready when one of the following happens:

     * other and other.get() are both ready. The value or exception from other.get() is
       stored in the shared state associated with the resulting shared_future object.
     * other is ready, but other.get() is invalid. An exception of type
       std::future_error with an error condition of std::future_errc::broken_promise is
       stored in the shared state associated with the resulting shared_future object.

   After this constructor returns, valid() == true and other.valid() == false.

.SH Parameters

   other - A std::experimental::future object to unwrap
