.TH std::set::emplace_hint 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   template <class... Args>                                       \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element to the container, using hint as a suggestion where the element
   should go. The element is constructed in-place, i.e. no copy or move operations are
   performed.

   The constructor of the element is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied
   to the function, forwarded with std::forward<Args>(args)....

   No iterators or references are invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   hint - iterator, used as a suggestion as to where to insert the new element
   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   Returns an iterator to the newly inserted element.

   If the insertion failed because the element already exists, returns an iterator to
   the already existing element with the equivalent key.

.SH Complexity

   Logarithmic in the size of the container in general, but amortized constant if the
   new element is inserted just before hint.
