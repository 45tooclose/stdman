   reference       operator[]( size_type pos );
   const_reference operator[]( size_type pos ) const;

   Returns a reference to the character at specified location pos. No bounds checking
   is performed.

   1) If pos == size(), the behavior is undefined.
   2) If pos == size(), a reference to the character with value CharT()   \fI(until C++11)\fP
   (the null character) is returned.
