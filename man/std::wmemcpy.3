.SH NAME
std::wmemcpy \- std::wmemcpy

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   wchar_t* wmemcpy( wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, std::size_t count );

   Copies count wide characters from the object pointed to by src to the object pointed
   to by dest. If the objects overlap, the behavior is undefined. If the objects are
   not trivially copyable (scalars, arrays, C-compatible structs), the behavior is
   undefined.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the memory location to copy to
   src   - pointer to the memory location to copy from
   count - number of wide characters to copy

.SH Return value

   dest
