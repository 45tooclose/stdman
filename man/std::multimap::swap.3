.SH NAME
std::multimap::swap \- std::multimap::swap

.SH Synopsis
   void swap( multimap& other );

   Exchanges the contents of the container with those of other. Does not invoke any
   move, copy, or swap operations on individual elements.

   All iterators and references remain valid. The past-the-end iterator is invalidated.

   The Pred objects must be Swappable, and they are exchanged using unqualified call to
   non-member swap.

   If std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap::value
   is true, then the allocators are exchanged using an unqualified call to       (since
   non-member swap. Otherwise, they are not swapped (and if get_allocator() !=   C++11)
   other.get_allocator(), the behavior is undefined).

.SH Parameters

   other - container to exchange the contents with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   Any exception thrown by the swap of the Compare objects.                   (until
                                                                              C++17)
   noexcept specification:                                                    (since
   noexcept(std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal::value          C++17)
   && noexcept(std::swap(std::declval<Compare&>(),std::declval<Compare&>())))

.SH Complexity

   Constant.
