.TH std::basic_iostream::~basic_iostream 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   virtual ~basic_iostream();

   Destructs the input/output stream.

.SH Notes

   This destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying stream buffer
   (rdbuf()): the destructors of the derived streams such as std::basic_fstream and
   std::basic_stringstream are responsible for calling the destructors of the stream
   buffers.
