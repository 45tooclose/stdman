.TH std::logic_error 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class logic_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that are a
   consequence of faulty logic within the program such as violating logical
   preconditions or class invariants and may be preventable.

   No standard library components throw this exception directly, but the exception
   types std::invalid_argument, std::domain_error, std::length_error,
   std::out_of_range, std::future_error, and std::experimental::bad_optional_access are
   derived from std::logic_error.
