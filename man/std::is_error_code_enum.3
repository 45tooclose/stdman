.TH std::is_error_code_enum 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <system_error>
   template< class T >               \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_error_code_enum;

   If T is an error code enumeration, this template provides the member constant value
   equal true. For any other type, value is false.

   This template may be specialized for a user-defined type to indicate that the type
   is eligible for std::error_code and std::error_condition automatic conversions.

   The following classes of the standard library are an error code enum:

     * std::io_errc
     * std::future_errc.
