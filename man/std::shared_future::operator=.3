.SH Synopsis
   shared_future& operator=( const shared_future& other ); \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   shared_future& operator=( shared_future&& other );      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Assigns the contents of another shared_future.

   1) Releases any shared state and assigns the contents of other to *this. After the
   assignment, this->valid() == other.valid().
   2) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to *this. After
   the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid() will yield the same value
   as other.valid() before the assignment.

   other - a std::shared_future that will transfer state to *this

.SH Return value

   *this
