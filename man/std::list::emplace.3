.SH NAME
std::list::emplace \- std::list::emplace

.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >                                \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator emplace( const_iterator pos, Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element into the container directly before pos. The element is
   constructed in-place, i.e. no copy or move operations are performed. The constructor
   of the element is called with the arguments std::forward<Args>(args).... The element
   type must be EmplaceConstructible.

   No iterators or references are invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   pos  - iterator before which the new element will be constructed
   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   Iterator pointing to the emplaced element.

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown (e.g. by the constructor), the container is left
   unmodified, as if this function was never called \fI(strong exception guarantee)\fP.
