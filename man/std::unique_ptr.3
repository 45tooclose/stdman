   std::unique_ptr is a smart pointer that retains sole ownership of an object through
   a pointer and destroys that object when the unique_ptr goes out of scope. No two
   unique_ptr instances can manage the same object.

   The object is destroyed and its memory deallocated when either of the following
   happens:

     * unique_ptr managing the object is destroyed
     * unique_ptr managing the object is assigned another pointer via operator= or
       reset().

   The object is destroyed using a potentially user-supplied deleter by calling
   Deleter(ptr). The deleter calls the destructor of the object and dispenses the
   memory.

   A unique_ptr may also own no objects, in which case it is called empty.

   There are two versions of std::unique_ptr:

   1) Manages the lifetime of a single object (e.g. allocated with new)
   2) Manages the lifetime of a dynamically-allocated array of objects (e.g. allocated
   with new[])

   The class satisfies the requirements of MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable, but
   not the requirements of either CopyConstructible or CopyAssignable.

.SH Notes

   Only non-const unique_ptr can transfer the ownership of the managed object to
   another unique_ptr. The lifetime of an object managed by const std::unique_ptr is
   limited to the scope in which the pointer was created.

   Typical uses of std::unique_ptr include:

     * providing exception safety to classes and functions that handle objects with
       dynamic lifetime, by guaranteeing deletion on both normal exit and exit through
       exception

     * passing ownership of uniquely-owned objects with dynamic lifetime into functions

     * acquiring ownership of uniquely-owned objects with dynamic lifetime from
       functions

     * as the element type in move-aware containers, such as std::vector, which hold
       pointers to dynamically-allocated objects (e.g. if polymorphic behavior is
       desired)

.SH Member types

   Member type  Definition
   pointer      std::remove_reference<Deleter>::type::pointer if that type exists,
                otherwise T*
   element_type T, the type of the object managed by this unique_ptr
   deleter_type Deleter, the function object or lvalue reference to function or to
                function object, to be called from the destructor

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <memory>

 struct Foo
 {
     Foo()      { std::cout << "Foo::Foo\\n";  }
     ~Foo()     { std::cout << "Foo::~Foo\\n"; }
     void bar() { std::cout << "Foo::bar\\n";  }
 };

 void f(const Foo &)
 {
     std::cout << "f(const Foo&)\\n";
 }

 int main()
 {
     std::unique_ptr<Foo> p1(new Foo);  // p1 owns Foo
     if (p1) p1->bar();

     {
         std::unique_ptr<Foo> p2(std::move(p1));  // now p2 owns Foo
         f(*p2);

         p1 = std::move(p2);  // ownership returns to p1
         std::cout << "destroying p2...\\n";
     }

     if (p1) p1->bar();

     // Foo instance is destroyed when p1 goes out of scope
 }

.SH Output:

 Foo::Foo
 Foo::bar
 f(const Foo&)
