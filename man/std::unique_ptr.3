   std::unique_ptr is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a
   pointer and disposes of that object when the unique_ptr goes out of scope.

   The object is disposed of using the associated deleter when either of the following
   happens:

     * the managing unique_ptr object is destroyed
     * the managing unique_ptr object is assigned another pointer via operator= or
       reset().

   The object is disposed of using a potentially user-supplied deleter by calling
   get_deleter()(ptr). The default deleter uses the delete operator, which destroys the
   object and deallocates the memory.

   A unique_ptr may alternatively own no object, in which case it is called empty.

   There are two versions of std::unique_ptr:

   1) Manages a single object (e.g. allocated with new)
   2) Manages a dynamically-allocated array of objects (e.g. allocated with new[])

   The class satisfies the requirements of MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable, but
   not the requirements of either CopyConstructible or CopyAssignable.

.SH Type requirements
   -
   Deleter must be FunctionObject or lvalue reference to a FunctionObject or lvalue
   reference to function, callable with an argument of type unique_ptr<T,
   Deleter>::pointer

.SH Notes

   Only non-const unique_ptr can transfer the ownership of the managed object to
   another unique_ptr. If an object's lifetime is managed by a const std::unique_ptr,
   it is limited to the scope in which the pointer was created.

   std::unique_ptr is commonly used to manage the lifetime of objects, including:

     * providing exception safety to classes and functions that handle objects with
       dynamic lifetime, by guaranteeing deletion on both normal exit and exit through
       exception

     * passing ownership of uniquely-owned objects with dynamic lifetime into functions

     * acquiring ownership of uniquely-owned objects with dynamic lifetime from
       functions

     * as the element type in move-aware containers, such as std::vector, which hold
       pointers to dynamically-allocated objects (e.g. if polymorphic behavior is
       desired)

   std::unique_ptr may be constructed for an incomplete type T, such as to facilitate
   the use as a handle in the pImpl idiom. If the default deleter is used, T must be
   complete at the point in code where the deleter is invoked, which happens in the
   destructor, move assignment operator, and reset member function of std::unique_ptr.
   (Conversely, std::shared_ptr can't be constructed from a raw pointer to incomplete
   type, but can be destroyed where T is incomplete). Note that if T is a class
   template specialization, use of unique_ptr as an operand, e.g. !p requires T's
   parameters to be complete due to ADL.

   If T is a derived class of some base B, then std::unique_ptr<T> is implicitly
   convertible to std::unique_ptr<B>. The default deleter of the resulting
   std::unique_ptr<B> will use operator delete for B, leading to undefined behavior
   unless the destructor of B is virtual. Note that std::shared_ptr behaves
   differently: std::shared_ptr<B> will use the operator delete for the type T and the
   owned object will be deleted correctly even if the destructor of B is not virtual.

   Unlike std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr may manage an object through any custom
   handle type that satisfies NullablePointer. This allows, for example, managing
   objects located in shared memory, by supplying a Deleter that defines typedef
   boost::offset_ptr pointer;

.SH Member types

   Member type  Definition
   pointer      std::remove_reference<Deleter>::type::pointer if that type exists,
                otherwise T*. Must satisfy NullablePointer
   element_type T, the type of the object managed by this unique_ptr
   deleter_type Deleter, the function object or lvalue reference to function or to
                function object, to be called from the destructor

// Run this code

     ~Foo()     { std::cout << "Foo::~Foo\\n"; }
     void bar() { std::cout << "Foo::bar\\n";  }

 void f(const Foo &)

 int main()
 {
     std::unique_ptr<Foo> p1(new Foo);  // p1 owns Foo

     {
         std::unique_ptr<Foo> p2(std::move(p1));  // now p2 owns Foo
         f(*p2);

         p1 = std::move(p2);  // ownership returns to p1
         std::cout << "destroying p2...\\n";
     }

     if (p1) p1->bar();

     // Foo instance is destroyed when p1 goes out of scope
 }
