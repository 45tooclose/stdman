std::remainder \- std::remainder

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cmath>
   float       remainder( float x, float y );             \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   double      remainder( double x, double y );           \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   long double remainder( long double x, long double y ); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   Promoted    remainder( Arithmetic1 x, Arithmetic2 y ); \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Computes the signed remainder of the floating point division operation x/y.

   Specifically, the returned value is x - n*y, where n is x/y rounded to the nearest
   integer, or the nearest even integer if x/y is halfway between two integers.

   In contrast to std::fmod(), the returned value is not guaranteed to have the same
   sign as x.

   If the returned value is 0, it will have the same sign as x.

   4) If any argument has integral type, it is cast to double. If any other argument is
   long double, then the return type is long double, otherwise it is double

.SH Parameters

   x, y - values of floating-point or integral types

.SH Return value

   Remainder of dividing arguments.
