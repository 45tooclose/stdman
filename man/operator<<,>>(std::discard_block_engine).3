   1) Serializes the internal state of the pseudo-random number engine adaptor as a
   sequence of decimal numbers separated by one or more spaces, and inserts it to the
   stream ost. The fill character and the formatting flags of the stream are ignored
   and unaffected.
   2) Restores the internal state of the pseudo-random number engine adaptor e from the
   serialized representation, which was created by an earlier call to operator<< using
   a stream with the same imbued locale and the same CharT and Traits. If the input
   cannot be deserialized, e is left unchanged and failbit is raised on ist

   If a textual representation is written using os << x and that representation is
   restored into the same or a different object y of the same type using is >> y, then
   x==y.

    Reason: standard also defines what the textual representation consists of
