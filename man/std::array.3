   std::size_t N

   > struct array;

   std::array is a container that encapsulates constant size arrays.

   This container is an aggregate type with the same semantics as a struct holding a
   C-style array T[N] as its only non-static data member. It can be initialized with
   aggregate-initialization, given at most N initializers that are convertible to T:
   std::array<int, 3> a = {1,2,3};

   The struct combines the performance and accessibility of a C-style array with the
   benefits of a standard container, such as knowing its own size, supporting
   assignment, random access iterators, etc.

   There is a special case for a zero-length array (N == 0). In that case,
   array.begin() == array.end(), which is some unique value. The effect of calling
   front() or back() on a zero-sized array is undefined.

   An array can also be used as a tuple of N elements of the same type.

// Run this code

     std::array<int, 3> a2 = {1, 2, 3}; // except after =
     std::array<std::string, 2> a3 = { {std::string("a"), "b"} };
