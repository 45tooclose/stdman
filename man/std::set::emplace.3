.TH std::set::emplace 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >                            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::pair<iterator,bool> emplace( Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element into the container by constructing it in-place with the given
   args if there is no element with the key in the container.

   Careful use of emplace allows the new element to be constructed while avoiding
   unnecessary copy or move operations. The constructor of the new element is called
   with exactly the same arguments as supplied to emplace, forwarded via
   std::forward<Args>(args)....

   No iterators or references are invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   Returns a pair consisting of an iterator to the inserted element, or the
   already-existing element if no insertion happened, and a bool denoting whether the
   insertion took place.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown by any operation, this function has no effect.

.SH Complexity

   Logarithmic in the size of the container.
