   std::unexpected() is called by the C++ runtime when a dynamic exception
   specification is violated: an exception is thrown from a function whose exception
   specification forbids exceptions of this type.

   std::unexpected() may also be called directly from the program.

   In either case, std::unexpected calls the currently installed
   std::unexpected_handler. The default std::unexpected_handler calls std::terminate.
