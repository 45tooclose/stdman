std::range_error \- std::range_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class range_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that arise
   because floating point value in some computation could not be represented because it
   was too large or too small in magnitude. If the value has integral type,
   std::underflow_error or std::overflow_error should be used.
