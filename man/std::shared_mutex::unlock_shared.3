.SH Synopsis
   void unlock_shared();  \fI(since C++14)\fP

   Releases the mutex from shared ownership by the calling thread. . The mutex must be
   locked by the current thread of execution in shared mode, otherwise, the behavior is
   undefined.

   This operation synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) any subsequent
   lock() operation that obtains ownership of the same mutex.
