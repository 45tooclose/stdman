.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ratio>
   template< class R1, class R2 >
   struct ratio_less : std::integral_constant;

   If the ratio R1 is less than the ratio R2, provides the member constant value equal
   true. Otherwise, value is false.

.SH Member constants

   value    true if R1::num * R2::den < R2::num * R1::den, or equivalent expression
   \fB[static]\fP that avoids overflow , false otherwise
            \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   operator bool converts the object to bool, returns value
                 \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Member types

   Type       Definition
   value_type bool
   type       std::integral_constant<bool, value>

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <ratio>

 int main()
 {
     if (std::ratio_less<std::ratio<23,37>, std::ratio<57,90>>::value) {
         std::cout << "23/37 < 57/90\\n";
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 23/37 < 57/90
