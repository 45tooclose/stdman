   1) Serializes the internal state of the pseudo-random number engine e as a sequence
   of decimal numbers separated by one or more spaces, and inserts it to the stream
   ost. The fill character and the formatting flags of the stream are ignored and
   unaffected.
   2) Restores the internal state of the pseudo-random number engine e from the
   serialized representation, which was created by an earlier call to operator<< using
   a stream with the same imbued locale and the same CharT and Traits. If the input
   cannot be deserialized, e is left unchanged and failbit is raised on ist

   If a textual representation is written using os << x and that representation is
   restored into the same or a different object y of the same type using is >> y, then
   x==y.

   The textual representation is written with os.''fmtflags'' set to
   ios_base::dec|ios_base::left and the fill character set to the space character. The
   textual representation of the engine's internal state is a set of decimal numbers
   separated by spaces.
