.SH Synopsis
   class Init;

   This class is used to ensure that the default C++ streams (std::cin, std::cout,
   etc.) are properly initialized and destructed. The class tracks how many instances
   of it are created and initializes the C++ streams when the first instance is
   constructed as well as flushes the output streams when the last instance is
   destructed.

   The header <iostream> declares (directly or indirectly) an instance of
   std::ios_base::Init with static storage duration, whose definition is provided by
   the C++ library: this makes it safe to access the standard I/O streams in the
   constructors and destructors of static objects (as long as #include <iostream> is
   present in the translation unit)
