   std::basic_ostream<charT,traits>& ends( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os );

   Inserts a null character into the output sequence os as if by calling

.SH Notes

   This manipulator is typically used with std::ostrstream, when the associated output
   buffer needs to be null-terminated to be processed as a C string.

   Unlike std::endl, this manipulator does not flush the stream.

.SH Parameters

   os - reference to output stream

.SH Return value

   os (reference to the stream after insertion of the null character)

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstdio>
 #include <strstream>
 int main()
 {
     std::ostrstream oss;
     oss << "Sample text: " << 42 << std::ends;
     std::printf("%s\\n", oss.str());
     oss.freeze(false); // enable memory deallocation
 }

.SH Output:

 Sample text: 42
