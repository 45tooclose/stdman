.TH std::priority_queue 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <queue>
   template<

   class T,
   class Container = std::vector<T>,
   class Compare = std::less<typename Container::value_type>

   > class priority_queue;

   A priority queue is a container adaptor that provides constant time maximum (or
   minimum, depending on Compare) extraction at the expense of logarithmic insertion.

   Working with a priority_queue is similar to managing a heap in some random access
   container, with the benefit of not being able to accidentally invalidate the heap.
