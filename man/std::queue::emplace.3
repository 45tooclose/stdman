.TH std::queue::emplace 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >        \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void emplace( Args&&... args );

   Pushes new element to the end of the queue. The element is constructed in-place,
   i.e. no copy or move operations are performed. The constructor of the element is
   called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function.

   Effectively calls c.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...)
