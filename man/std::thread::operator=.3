.TH std::thread::operator= 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   thread& operator=( thread&& other );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   If *this still has an associated running thread (i.e. joinable() == true), call
   std::terminate(). Otherwise, assigns the state of other to *this and sets other to a
   default constructed state.

   After this call, this->get_id() is equal to the value of other.get_id() prior to the
   call, and other no longer represents a thread of execution.

.SH Parameters

   other - another thread object to assign to this thread object

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept
.SH Category:

     * unconditionally noexcept
