   void setbuf( FILE* stream, char* buffer );

   Sets the internal buffer to use for I/O operations performed on the C stream stream.

   If buffer is not null, equivalent to std::setvbuf(stream, buffer, _IOFBF, BUFSIZ)

   If buffer is null, equivalent to std::setvbuf(stream, NULL, _IONBF, 0), which turns
   off buffering.

            pointer to a buffer for the stream to use. If NULL is supplied, the
