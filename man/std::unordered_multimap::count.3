.SH Parameters

   key - key value of the elements to count

.SH Return value

   Number of elements with key key.

.SH Complexity

   Constant on average, worst case linear in the size of the container.

.SH Notes

   Typical implementations execute one constant-type hash lookup followed by as many
   equality comparisons as there are elements with the keys that compare equal to key,
   so the actual complexity is linear in the number of matching elements.
