.SH Parameters

   str - character string to be written

.SH Return value

   str on success, NULL on failure.

   If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally sets the eof
   indicator (see std::feof()) on stdin. If the failure has been caused by some other
   error, sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stdin.

.SH Notes

   The bounds checking is not performed, therefore this function is extremely
   vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks. Use fgets() instead.
