.SH Synopsis
   void swap( stack& other );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Exchanges the contents of the container adaptor with those of other. Effectively
   calls using std::swap; swap(c, other.c);

.SH Parameters

   other - container adaptor to exchange the contents with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:                               \fI(until C++17)\fP
   noexcept(noexcept(std::swap(c, other.c)))
   noexcept specification:                               \fI(since C++17)\fP
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_swappable<Container>::value)

.SH Complexity

   Same as underlying container (typically constant)
