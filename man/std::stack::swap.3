.SH Synopsis
   void swap( stack& other );  (since {std})

   Exchanges the contents of the container adaptor with those of other. Effectively
   calls using std::swap; swap(c, other.c);

.SH Parameters

   other - container adaptor to exchange the contents with

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP                                    \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification:  \fI(since C++11)\fP    (since C++11)
   noexcept(noexcept(std::swap(c, other.c)))

   Same as underlying container (linear if Container is std::array, constant
   otherwise).
