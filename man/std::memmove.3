.TH std::memmove 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   void* memmove( void* dest, const void* src, std::size_t count );

   Copies count characters from the object pointed to by src to the object pointed to
   by dest. The objects may overlap: copying takes place as if the characters were
   copied to a temporary character array and then the characters were copied from the
   array to dest. If the objects are not trivially-copyable (scalars, arrays, C-style
   structs), the behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the memory location to copy to
   src   - pointer to the memory location to copy from
   count - number of bytes to copy

.SH Return value

   dest
