.TH std::queue 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <queue>
   template<

   class T,
   class Container = std::deque<T>

   > class queue;

   The std::queue class is a container adapter that gives the programmer the
   functionality of a queue - specifically, a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data
   structure.

   The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container - only a specific
   set of functions is provided. The queue pushes the elements on the back of the
   underlying container and pops them from the front.

.SH Template parameters

   T         - The type of the stored elements.
               The type of the underlying container to use to store the elements. The
               container must satisfy the requirements of SequenceContainer.
               Additionally, it must provide the following functions with the usual
               semantics:

   Container -   • back()
                 • front()
                 • push_back()
                 • pop_front()

               The standard containers std::deque and std::list satisfy these
               requirements.
