   );

   Loads the data from the given locations, converts them to character string
   equivalents and writes the results to a variety of sinks.

   1) Writes the results to stdout.
   2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.
   3) Writes the results to a character string buffer.
   4) Writes the results to a character string buffer. At most buf_size - 1 characters
   are written. The resulting character string will be terminated with a null
   character, unless buf_size is zero.

.SH Parameters

stream   - output file stream to write to
buffer   - pointer to a character string to write to
buf_size - up to buf_size - 1 characters may be written, plus the null terminator
           pointer to a null-terminated multibyte string specifying how to interpret the data.

           The format string consists of ordinary characters (except %), which are copied unchanged into the output
           stream, and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

             * introductory % character

             * (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the conversion:

             * -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within the field (by default it is
               right-justified)
             * +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to the result of the conversion (by default
               the result is preceded by minus only when it is negative)
             * space: if the result of a signed conversion does not start with a sign character, or is empty, space
               is prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is present.
             * # : alternative form of the conversion is performed. See the table below for exact effects.
             * 0 : for integer and floating point number conversions, leading zeros are used to pad the field
               instead of space characters. For floating point numbers it is ignored if the precision is explicitly
               specified. For other conversions using this flag results in undefined behavior. It is ignored if -
               flag is present.

             * (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field width. The result is padded with space
               characters (by default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on the right if
               left-justified. In the case when * is used, the width is specified by an additional argument of type
               int. If the value of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag specified and positive
               field width.

             * (optional) . followed by integer number or * that specifies precision of the conversion. In the case
               when * is used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of type int. If the value of
               this argument is negative, it is ignored. See the table below for exact effects of precision.

             * (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the argument

             * conversion format specifier

           The following format specifiers are available:

.SH Notes:

           The floating point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or infinity. Which one is used is
           implementation defined.
           Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is used is implementation defined.
           The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.
           The correct conversion specifiers for the fixed-width character types (std:int8_t, etc) are defined in
           the header <cinttypes>
           arguments specifying data to print. If any argument is not the type expected by the corresponding
...      - conversion specifier, or if there are less arguments than required by format, the behavior is undefined.
           If there are more arguments than required by format, the extraneous arguments are evaluated and ignored

.SH Return value

   1-2) Number of characters written if successful or negative value if an error
   occurred.
   3) Number of characters written if successful (not including the terminating
   null-byte) or negative value if an error occurred.
   4) Number of characters written if successful (not including the terminating
   null-byte) or negative value if an error occurred. If the resulting string gets
   truncated due to buf_size limit, function returns the total number of characters
   (not including the terminating null-byte) which would have been written, if the
   limit was not imposed.
