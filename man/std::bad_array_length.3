.TH std::bad_array_length 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <new>
   class bad_array_length : public std::bad_alloc;  \fI(since C++14)\fP

   std::bad_array_length is the type of the object thrown as exceptions by the
   constructors of arrays of runtime bound and objects of type std::dynarray to report
   invalid array lengths if

   1) array length is negative or equal to zero (for arrays of runtime bound)
   2) total size of the new array would exceed implementation-defined maximum value
   (for both arrays of runtime bound and std::dynarray)
