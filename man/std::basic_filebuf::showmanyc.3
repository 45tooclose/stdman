.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The number of characters available for reading from the file, or -1 if the end of
   file was reached.

.SH Notes

   This function is optional. If not implemented, this function returns 0 (since the
   base class version std::basic_streambuf::showmanyc gets called)

   Whether implemented or not, this function is normally called by
   std::basic_streambuf::in_avail if the get area is empty.

.SH Example

   implementation test to see if showmanyc() is implemented for filebuf

   
// Run this code

 #include <fstream>
 #include <iostream>

 struct mybuf : std::filebuf
 {
      using std::filebuf::showmanyc;
 };

 int main()
 {
     mybuf fin;
     fin.open("test.in", std::ios_base::in);
     std::cout << "showmanyc() returns " << fin.showmanyc() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 showmanyc() returns 6626
