.TH std::deque::erase 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   iterator erase( iterator pos );                          \fI(until C++11)\fP
   iterator erase( const_iterator pos );                    \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator erase( iterator first, iterator last ); \fB(1)\fP                   \fI(until C++11)\fP
   iterator erase( const_iterator first,                \fB(2)\fP               \fI(since C++11)\fP
   const_iterator last );

   Removes specified elements from the container.

   1) Removes the element at pos.
   2) Removes the elements in the range [first; last).

   All iterators and references are invalidated, unless the erased elements are at the
   end or the beginning of the container, in which case only the iterators and
   references to the erased elements are invalidated.

   It is unspecified when the past-the-end iterator is invalidated.       \fI(until C++11)\fP
   The past-the-end iterator is also invalidated unless the erased
   elements are at the beginning of the container and the last element is \fI(since C++11)\fP
   not erased.

   The iterator pos must be valid and dereferenceable. Thus the end() iterator (which
   is valid, but is not dereferencable) cannot be used as a value for pos.

.SH Parameters

   pos         - iterator to the element to remove
   first, last - range of elements to remove

.SH Return value

   Iterator following the last removed element.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <deque>
 #include <iostream>
  
  
 int main( )
 {
     std::deque<int> c{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
     for (auto &i : c) {
         std::cout << i << " ";
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
  
     c.erase(c.begin());
  
     for (auto &i : c) {
         std::cout << i << " ";
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
  
     c.erase(c.begin()+2, c.begin()+5);
  
     for (auto &i : c) {
         std::cout << i << " ";
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 1 2 6 7 8 9

.SH Complexity

   1) Linear in the distance between position and last.
   2) Linear in distance between position and the end of the container.
