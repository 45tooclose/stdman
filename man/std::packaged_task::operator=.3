.SH Synopsis
   packaged_task& operator=( const packaged_task& ) = delete; \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   packaged_task& operator=( packaged_task&& rhs );           \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1) Copy assignment operator is deleted, std::packaged_task is move-only. Note: C++11
   does not specify const here, this is the defect 2067.
   2) Releases the shared state, if any, destroys the previously-held task, and moves
   the shared state and the task owned by rhs into *this. rhs is left without a shared
   state and with a moved-from task.

.SH Parameters

   rhs - the std::packaged_task to move from

.SH Exceptions
