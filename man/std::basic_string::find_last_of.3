.SH Synopsis
   size_type find_last_of( const basic_string& str, size_type pos = npos ) const;  \fB(1)\fP
   size_type find_last_of( const CharT* s, size_type pos, size_type count ) const; \fB(2)\fP
   size_type find_last_of( const CharT* s, size_type pos = npos ) const;           \fB(3)\fP
   size_type find_last_of( CharT ch, size_type pos = npos ) const;                 \fB(4)\fP

   Finds the last character equal to one of characters in the given character sequence.
   Search begins at pos, i.e. only the substring [0, pos] is considered in the search.
   If npos is passed as pos whole string will be searched.

   1) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in str.
   2) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in the first count characters
   of the character string pointed to by s. s can include null characters.
   3) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in character string pointed
   to by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null character.
   4) Finds the last character equal to ch.

.SH Parameters

   str   - string identifying characters to search for
   pos   - position at which the search is to finish
   count - length of character string identifying characters to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string identifying characters to search fo
   ch    - character to search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the found character or npos if no such character is found.
