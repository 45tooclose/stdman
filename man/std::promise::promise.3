   Constructs a promise object.

   1) Default constructor. Constructs the promise with an empty shared state.
   2) Constructs the promise with an empty shared state. The shared state is allocated
   using alloc. Alloc must meet the requirements of Allocator.
   3) Move constructor. Constructs the promise with the shared state of other using
   move semantics. other is in valid, but undefined state afterwards.
   4) promise is not copyable.

.SH Parameters

   alloc - allocator to use to allocate the shared state
   other - another promise to acquire the state from
