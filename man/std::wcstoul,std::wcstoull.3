.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   unsigned long wcstoul( const wchar_t* str, wchar_t** str_end, int
   base );
   unsigned long long wcstoull( const wchar_t* str, wchar_t** str_end,    \fI(since C++11)\fP
   int base );

   Interprets an unsigned integer value in a wide string pointed to by str.

   Function discards any whitespace characters (as identified by calling isspace())
   until first non-whitespace character is found. Then it takes as many characters as
   possible to form a valid base-n (where n=base) unsigned integer number
   representation and converts them to an integer value. The valid unsigned integer
   value consists of the following parts:

     * (optional) prefix \fB(0)\fP indicating octal base (applies only when the base is 8 or
       0)
     * (optional) prefix (0x or 0X) indicating hexadecimal base (applies only when the
       base is 16 or 0)
     * a sequence of digits

   The set of valid digits for base-2 integer is 01, for base-3 integer is 012, and so
   on. For bases larger than 10, valid digits include alphabetic characters, starting
   from Aa for base-11 integer, to Zz for base-36 integer. The case of the characters
   is ignored. In non-default locales, additional numeric formats may be accepted.

   If the value of base is 0, the numeric base is auto-detected: if the prefix is 0,
   the base is octal, if the prefix is 0x or 0X, the base is hexadecimal, otherwise the
   base is decimal.

   The functions sets the pointer pointed to by str_end to point to the wide character
   past the last character interpreted. If str_end is NULL, it is ignored.

.SH Parameters

   str     - pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be interpreted
   str_end - pointer to a pointer to a wide character.
   base    - base of the interpreted integer value

.SH Return value

   Integer value corresponding to the contents of str on success. If the converted
   value falls out of range of corresponding return type, range error occurs and
   ULONG_MAX or ULLONG_MAX is returned. If no conversion can be performed, 0 is
   returned.
