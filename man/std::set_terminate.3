.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <exception>
   std::terminate_handler set_terminate( std::terminate_handler f );

   Makes f the new global terminate handler function and returns the previously
   installed std::terminate_handler.

   This function is thread-safe. Every call to std::set_terminate
   synchronizes-with (see std::memory_order) the subsequent               \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::set_terminate and std::get_terminate

.SH Parameters

   f - pointer to function of type std::terminate_handler, or null pointer

.SH Return value

   The previously-installed terminate handler, or a null pointer value if none was
   installed.

   \fI(none)\fP                  \fI(until C++11)\fP
