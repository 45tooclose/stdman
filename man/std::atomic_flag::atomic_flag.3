.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <atomic>
   atomic_flag();                              \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   atomic_flag( const atomic_flag& ) = delete; \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new std::atomic_flag.

   1) Trivial default constructor, initializes std::atomic_flag to unspecified state.

   2) The copy constructor is deleted; std::atomic_flag is not copyable.

   In addition, std::atomic_flag can be value-initialized to clear state with the
   expression ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT. For an atomic_flag with static storage duration, this
   guarantees that the values of this flag is known before any constructors are run for
   static objects.
