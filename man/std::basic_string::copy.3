.SH Synopsis
   size_type copy( CharT* dest,

   size_type count,

   size_type pos = 0) const;

   Copies a substring [pos, pos+count) to character string pointed to by dest. If the
   requested substring lasts past the end of the string, or if count == npos, the
   copied substring is [pos, size()). The resulting character string is not
   null-terminated.

   If pos >= size(), std::out_of_range is thrown.
