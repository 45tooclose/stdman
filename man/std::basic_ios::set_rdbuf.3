.TH std::basic_ios::set_rdbuf 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   void set_rdbuf( std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>* sb );

   Sets the associated stream buffer to sb without clearing the error state.

   This member function is protected: it is called by the move constructors of the
   derived streams such as std::basic_ofstream or std::basic_istringstream, as the
   final step after constructing the base class and after moving the stream buffer:
   only the most derived stream class knows how to correctly move the stream buffer,
   but std::basic_ios needs to be made aware of the stream's new location so that its
   public member functions can access it.
