.TH std::binary_search 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class ForwardIt, class T >                                            \fB(1)\fP
   bool binary_search( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, const T& value );
   template< class ForwardIt, class T, class Compare >
   bool binary_search( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, const T& value, Compare    \fB(2)\fP
   comp );

   Checks if an element equivalent to value appears within the range [first, last).

   For std::binary_search to succeed, the range [first, last) must be at least
   partially ordered, i.e. it must satisfy all of the following requirements:

     * partitioned with respect to element < value or comp(element, value)
     * partitioned with respect to !(value < element) or !comp(value, element)
     * for all elements, if element < value or comp(element, value) is true then
       !(value < element) or !comp(value, element) is also true

   A fully-sorted range meets these criteria, as does a range resulting from a call to
   std::partition.

   The first version uses operator< to compare the elements, the second version uses
   the given comparison function comp.

.SH Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to examine
   value       - value to compare the elements to
                 comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
                 requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
                 less (i.e. is ordered before) the second element.

                 The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
                 following:

                 bool cmp(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);

                 The signature does not need to have const &, but the function object
   comp        - must not modify the objects passed to it.
                 The type Type1 must be such that an object of type T can be implicitly
                 converted to Type1. The type Type2 must be such that an object of type
                 ForwardIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to Type2.
                 

                  This section is incomplete
                  Reason: Update type requirements? The types Type1 and Type2 must be
                  such that an object of type T can be implicitly converted to either
                  type, and such that an object of type ForwardIt can be dereferenced
                  and then implicitly converted to either type. Generally Type1 and
                  Type2 will be the same type, although this is not required.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of ForwardIterator.

.SH Return value

   true if an element equal to value is found, false otherwise.

.SH Complexity

   The number of comparisons performed is logarithmic in the distance between first and
   last

.SH Possible implementation

.SH First version
   template<class ForwardIt, class T>
   bool binary_search(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, const T& value)
   {
       first = std::lower_bound(first, last, value);
       return (!(first == last) && !(value < *first));
   }
.SH Second version
   template<class ForwardIt, class T, class Compare>
   bool binary_search(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, const T& value, Compare comp)
   {
       first = std::lower_bound(first, last, value, comp);
       return (!(first == last) && !(comp(value, *first)));
   }

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <vector>

 int main()
 {
     std::vector<int> haystack {1, 3, 4, 5, 9};
     std::vector<int> needles {1, 2, 3};

     for (auto needle : needles) {
         std::cout << "Searching for " << needle << '\\n';
         if (std::binary_search(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(), needle)) {
             std::cout << "Found " << needle << '\\n';
         } else {
             std::cout << "no dice!\\n";
         }
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 Searching for 1
 Found 1
 Searching for 2
 no dice!
 Searching for 3
 Found 3
