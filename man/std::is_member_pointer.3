.TH std::is_member_pointer 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <type_traits>
   template< class T >              \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_member_pointer;

   If T is pointer to non-static member object or a pointer to non-static member
   function, provides the member constant value equal true. For any other type, value
   is false.

.SH Example

    This section is incomplete
    Reason: simplify

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <type_traits>

 int main() {
     class cls {};
     std::cout << (std::is_member_pointer<int(cls::*)>::value
                      ? "T is member pointer"
                      : "T is not a member pointer") << '\\n';
     std::cout << (std::is_member_pointer<int>::value
                      ? "T is member pointer"
                      : "T is not a member pointer") << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 T is member pointer
 T is not a member pointer
