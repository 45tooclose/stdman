.TH std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   static bool sync_with_stdio( bool sync = true );

   Sets whether the standard C++ streams are synchronized to the standard C streams
   after each input/output operation.

   The standard C++ streams are the following: std::cin, std::cout, std::cerr,
   std::clog, std::wcin, std::wcout, std::wcerr and std::wclog

   The standard C streams are the following: stdin, stdout, stderr and stdlog

   For a standard stream str, synchronized with the C stream f, the following pairs of
   functions have identical effect:

   1) std::fputc(f, c) and str.rdbuf()->sputc(c)
   2) std::fgetc(f) and str.rdbuf()->sbumpc()
   3) std::ungetc(c, f) and str.rdbuf()->sputbackc(c)

   In practice, this means that the C++ and the C streams use the same buffer, and
   therefore, can be mixed freely. In addition, synchronized C++ streams are guaranteed
   to be thread-safe (individual characters output from multiple threads may
   interleave, but no data races occur)

   If the synchronization is turned off, the C++ standard streams are allowed to buffer
   their I/O independently, which may be considerably faster in some cases.

   By default, all eight standard C++ streams are synchronized with their respective C
   streams.

   It is implementation-defined if this function has any effect if called after some
   I/O occurred on the standard stream.
