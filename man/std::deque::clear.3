.SH Synopsis
   void clear();

   Removes all elements from the container.

   Invalidates any references, pointers, or iterators referring to contained elements.
   May invalidate any past-the-end iterators.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the size of the container.

   clear is defined in terms of erase, which has linear complexity. \fI(until C++11)\fP
