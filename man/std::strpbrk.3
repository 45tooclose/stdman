   const char* strpbrk( const char* dest, const char* str );
       char* strpbrk(       char* dest, const char* str );

   Finds the first character in byte string pointed to by dest, that is also in byte
   string pointed to by str.

.SH Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed
   str  - pointer to the null-terminated byte string that contains the characters to
          search for

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the first character in dest, that is also in str, or NULL if no such
   character exists.

 #include <cstdio>
 #include <cstring>
  
 int main()
 {
     char* input = "hello world friend of mine";
     char* space = " ";
     char* pos = input;
     int word_counter = 0;
  
     do {
         pos = std::strpbrk(pos, space);
         word_counter++;
         pos ? pos++ : pos;
         std::printf("%d\\n", word_counter);
     } while (pos != NULL);
 };
