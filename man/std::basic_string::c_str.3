.TH std::basic_string::c_str 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   const CharT* c_str() const;

   Returns a pointer to a null-terminated character array with data equivalent to those
   stored in the string.

   The pointer is such that the range [c_str(); c_str() + size()] is valid and the
   values in it correspond to the values stored in the string with an additional null
   character after the last position.

   The pointer obtained from c_str() may be invalidated by:

     • Passing a non-const reference to the string to any standard library function, or
     • Calling non-const member functions on the string, excluding operator[], at(),
       front(), back(), begin(), rbegin(), end() and rend().

   Writing to the character array accessed through c_str() is undefined behavior.

   c_str() and data() perform the same function. \fI(since C++11)\fP

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the underlying character storage.

   data()[i] == operator[](i) for every i in [0, size()).   \fI(until C++11)\fP
   data() + i == &operator[](i) for every i in [0, size()]. \fI(since C++11)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Notes

   The pointer obtained from c_str() may only be treated as a pointer to a
   null-terminated character string if the string object does not contain other null
   characters.
