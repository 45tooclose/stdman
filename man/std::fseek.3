.TH std::fseek 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fseek( std::FILE* stream, long offset, int origin );

   Sets the file position indicator for the file stream stream.

   If the stream is open in binary mode, the new position is exactly offset bytes
   measured from the beginning of the file if origin is SEEK_SET, from the current file
   position if origin is SEEK_CUR, and from the end of the file if origin is SEEK_END.
   Some binary streams may not support the SEEK_END.

   If the stream is open in text mode, the only supported values for offset are zero
   (which works with any origin) and a value returned by an earlier call to std::ftell
   on a stream associated with the same file (which only works with origin of SEEK_SET.

   In addition to changing the file position indicator, fseek undoes the effects of
   std::ungetc and clears the end-of-file status, if applicable.

   If a read or write error occurs, the error indicator for the stream (std::ferror) is
   set and the file position is unaffected.
