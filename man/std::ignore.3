.TH std::ignore 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <tuple>
   const /*unspecified*/ ignore;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   An object of unspecified type such that any value can be assigned to it with no
   effect. Intended for use with std::tie when unpacking a std::tuple, as a placeholder
   for the arguments that are not used.

.SH Example

   unpack a pair returned by set.insert(), but only save the boolean.

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
 #include <set>
 #include <tuple>
 Â 
 int main()
 {
     std::set<std::string> set_of_str;
     bool inserted;
     std::tie(std::ignore, inserted) = set_of_str.insert("Test");
     if (inserted) {
         std::cout << "Value was inserted sucessfully\\n";
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 Value was inserted sucessfully

   tie creates a tuple of lvalue references or unpacks a tuple into individual objects
