.SH Synopsis
   template< class Key, class T, class Hash, class KeyEqual, class Allocator >

   void operator==( unordered_multimap<Key,T,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator> &lhs,    \fB(1)\fP

   unordered_multimap<Key,T,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator> &rhs);
   template< class Key, class T, class Hash, class KeyEqual, class Allocator >

   void operator!=( unordered_multimap<Key,T,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator> &lhs,    \fB(2)\fP

   unordered_multimap<Key,T,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator> &rhs);

   Compares the contents of two unordered containers.

   The contents of two unordered containers lhs and rhs are equal if the following
   conditions hold:

     * lhs.size() == rhs.size()
     * each group of equivalent keys [lhs_eq1, lhs_eq2) obtained from
       lhs.equal_range(lhs_eq1) has a corresponding group of equivalent keys in the
       other container [rhs_eq1, rhs_eq2) obtained from rhs.equal_range(rhs_eq1), that
       has the following properties:

     * std::distance(lhs_eq1, lhs_eq2) == std::distance(rhs_eq1, rhs_eq2).
     * std::is_permutation(lhs_eq1, lhs_eq2, rhs_eq1) == true.

   The behavior is undefined if Key or T are not EqualityComparable.

   The behavior is also undefined if Hash and KeyEqual do not have the same behavior on
   lhs and rhs or if the equality comparison operator for Key is not a refinement of
   the partition into equivalent-key groups introduced by KeyEqual (that is, if two
   keys that compare equal fall into different partitions)

.SH Parameters

   lhs, rhs - unordered containers to compare

.SH Return value

   1) true if the contents of the containers are equal, false otherwise
   2) true if the contents of the containers are not equal, false otherwise

.SH Complexity

   ΣS[i]^2 comparisons of the keys in the average case, where S is the size of the ith
   equivalent key group. N^2 comparisons of the keys in the worst case, where N is the
   size of the container.
