.SH Synopsis
   void reset();                                   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class Y >                             \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void reset( Y* ptr );
   template< class Y, class Deleter >              \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void reset( Y* ptr, Deleter d );
   template< class Y, class Deleter, class Alloc > \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void reset( Y* ptr, Deleter d, Alloc alloc );

   Replaces the managed object with an object pointed to by ptr. Optional deleter d can
   be supplied, which is later used to destroy the new object when no shared_ptr
   objects own it. By default, delete expression is used as deleter. Proper delete
   expression corresponding to the supplied type is always selected, this is the reason
   why the function is implemented as template using a separate parameter Y.

   If *this already owns an object and it is the last shared_ptr owning it, the object
   is destroyed through the owned deleter.

   If the object pointed to by ptr is already owned, the function results in undefined
   behavior.

   1) Releases the ownership of the managed object, if any. After the call, *this
   manages no object. Equivalent to shared_ptr().swap(*this);
   2-4) Replaces the managed object with an object pointed to by ptr. Y must be a
   complete type and implicitly convertible to T. Additionally:
   2) Uses the delete expression as the deleter. A valid delete expression must be
   available, i.e. delete ptr must be well formed, have well-defined behavior and not
   throw any exceptions. Effectively calls shared_ptr<T>(ptr).swap(*this);.
   3) Uses the specified deleter d as the deleter. Deleter must be callable for the
   type T, i.e. d(ptr) must be well formed, have well-defined behavior and not throw
   any exceptions. Deleter must be CopyConstructible. Effectively calls
   shared_ptr<T>(ptr, d).swap(*this);.
   4) Same as \fB(3)\fP, but additionally uses a copy of alloc for allocation of data for
   internal use. Alloc must be a Allocator. The copy constructor and destructor must
   not throw exceptions. Effectively calls shared_ptr<T>(ptr, d, alloc).swap(*this);.
