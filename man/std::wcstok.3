.TH std::wcstok 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   wchar_t* wcstok( wchar_t* str, const wchar_t* delim );

   Finds the next token in a null-terminated wide string pointed to by str. The
   separator characters are identified by null-terminated wide string pointed to by
   delim.

   If str != NULL, the function searches for the first wide character which is not
   separator. This character is the beginning of the token. Then the function searches
   for the first separator character. This character is the end of the token. Function
   terminates and returns NULL if end of str is encountered before end of the token is
   found. Otherwise, a pointer to end of the token is saved in a static location for
   subsequent invocations. This character is then replaced by a NULL-character and the
   function returns a pointer to the beginning of the token.

   If str == NULL, the function continues from where it left in previous invocation.
   The behavior is the same as if the previously stored pointer is passed as str.

.SH Parameters

   str   - pointer to the null-terminated wide string to tokenize
   delim - pointer to the null-terminated wide string identifying delimiters

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the beginning of a token if the end of examined string has not been
   encountered. Otherwise returns NULL>

.SH Note

   The function is not thread safe.
