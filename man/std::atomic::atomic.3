.SH NAME
std::atomic::atomic \- std::atomic::atomic

.SH Synopsis
   atomic() = default;               \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   constexpr atomic( T desired );    \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   atomic( const atomic& ) = delete; \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs new atomic variable.

   1) The default constructor is trivial: no initialization takes place other than zero
   initialization of static and thread-local objects. std::atomic_init may be used to
   complete initialization.
   2) Initializes the underlying value with desired. The initialization is not atomic.
   3) Atomic variables are not CopyConstructible.

.SH Parameters

   desired - value to initialize with
