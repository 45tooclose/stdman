std::mbrtoc16 \- std::mbrtoc16

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cuchar>
   std::size_t mbrtoc16( char16_t* pc16,

                         const char* s,         \fI(since C++11)\fP
                         std::size_t n,

                         std::mbstate_t* ps );

   Converts a narrow multibyte character to 16-bit character representation (typically,
   UTF-16).

   If s is not a null pointer, inspects at most n bytes of the multibyte character
   string, beginning with the byte pointed to by s to determine the number of bytes
   necessary to complete the next multibyte character (including any shift sequences).
   If the function determines that the next multibyte character in s is complete and
   valid, converts it to the corresponding 16-bit character and stores it in *pc16 (if
   pc16 is not null).

   If the multibyte character in *s corresponds to a multi-char16_t sequence (e.g. a
   surrogate pair in UTF-16), then after the first call to this function, *ps is
   updated in such a way that the next call to mbrtoc16 will write out the additional
   char16_t, without considering *s.

   If s is a null pointer, the values of n and pc16 are ignored and the call is
   equivalent to std::mbrtoc16(NULL, "", 1, ps).

   If the wide character produced is the null character, the conversion state *ps
   represents the initial shift state.

   If the macro __STDC_UTF_16__ is defined, the 16-bit encoding used by this function
   is UTF-16, otherwise it is implementation-defined.

.SH Parameters

   pc16 - pointer to the location where the resulting 16-bit character will be written
   s    - pointer to the multibyte character string used as input
   n    - limit on the number of bytes in s that can be examined
   ps   - pointer to the conversion state object used when interpreting the multibyte
          string

.SH Return value

   The first of the following that applies:

     * 0 if the character converted from s (and stored in *pc16 if non-null) was the
       null character
     * the number of bytes [1...n] of the multibyte character successfully converted
       from s
     * -3 if the next char16_t from a multi-char16_t character (e.g. a surrogate pair)
       has now been written to *pc16. No bytes are processed from the input in this
       case.
     * -2 if the next n bytes constitute an incomplete, but so far valid, multibyte
       character. Nothing is written to *pc16.
     * -1 if encoding error occurs. Nothing is written to *pc16, the value EILSEQ is
       stored in errno and the value if *ps is unspecified.
