.SH NAME
std::pmr::memory_resource::do_is_equal \- std::pmr::memory_resource::do_is_equal

.SH Synopsis
   virtual bool is_equal(const std::pmr::memory_resource& other) const =  \fI(since C++17)\fP
   0;

   Compares *this for equality with other.

   Two memory_resources compare equal if and only if memory allocated from one
   memory_resource can be deallocated from the other and vice versa.

.SH Notes

   The most-derived type of other may not match the most derived type of *this. A
   derived class implementation therefore must typically check whether the most derived
   types of *this and other match using dynamic_cast, and immediately return false if
   the cast fails.

.SH Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
