.SH NAME
std::allocator::allocate \- std::allocator::allocate

.SH Synopsis
   pointer allocate( size_type n, std::allocator<void>::const_pointer hint = 0 );

   Allocates n * sizeof(T) bytes of uninitialized storage by calling ::operator
   new(std::size_t), but it is unspecified when and how this function is called. The
   pointer hint may be used to provide locality of reference: the allocator, if
   supported by the implementation, will attempt to allocate the new memory block as
   close as possible to hint.

.SH Parameters

   n    - the number of objects to allocate storage for
   hint - pointer to a nearby memory location

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the first byte of a memory block suitably aligned and sufficient to hold
   an array of n objects of type T.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::bad_alloc if allocation fails.
