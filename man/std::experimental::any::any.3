.SH Synopsis
   any();                       \fB(1)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   any( const any& other );     \fB(2)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   any( any&& other );          \fB(3)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   template<typename ValueType> \fB(4)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
   any( ValueType&& value );

   Constructs a new any object.

   1) Constructs an empty object.
   2-3) Copies \fB(2)\fP or moves \fB(3)\fP content of other into a new instance, so that any
   content is equivalent in both type and value to other, or empty if other is empty.
   4) Constructs an object with initial content equivalent in both type and value to
   value. This overload only participates in overload resolution if
   std::decay_t<ValueType> is not the same type as any.

.SH Template parameters

   std::decay_t<ValueType> must meet the requirements of CopyConstructible.

.SH Parameters

   value - value to initialize the contained value with
