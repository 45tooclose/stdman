.TH std::tmpfile 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdio>
   FILE* tmpfile();

   Creates and opens a temporary file with unique auto-generated filename.

   The file is opened as binary file for update (as by std::fopen with access mode
   "wb+"). At least TMP_MAX files may be opened during the lifetime of a program (this
   limit may be shared with std::tmpnam and may be further limited by FOPEN_MAX)

   If the program closes the file, e.g. by executing std::fclose, the file is
   automatically deleted.

   If the program terminates normally (by calling std::exit, returning from main, etc),
   all files that were opened by calling std::tmpfile are also automatically deleted.

   If the program terminates abnormally, it is implementation-defined if these
   temporary files are deleted.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The associated file stream or NULL if an error has occurred

.SH Notes

   On some implementations (e.g. Linux), this function actually creates, opens, and
   immediately deletes the file from the file system: as long as an open file
   descriptor to a deleted file is held by a program, the file exists, but since it was
   deleted, its name does not appear in any directory, so that no other process can
   open it. Once the file descriptor is closed, the space occupied by the file is
   reclaimed by the filesystem.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cstdio>
 #include <cstdlib>

 int main()
 {
     FILE* tmpf = std::tmpfile();
     std::fputs("Hello, world", tmpf);
     std::rewind(tmpf);
     char buf[6];
     std::fgets(buf, sizeof buf, tmpf);
     std::cout << buf << '\\n';

     // Linux-specific method to display the tmpfile name
     std::system("ls -l /proc/self/fd/3");
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Hello
 lrwx------ 1 user group 64 Jun 27 00:28 /proc/self/fd/3 -> /tmp/tmpfXu58Zi (deleted)
