.SH Synopsis
   bool operator==( const error_category& rhs ) const; \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   bool operator!=( const error_category& rhs ) const; \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   bool operator<( const error_category& rhs ) const;  \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Compares to another error category.

   1) Checks whether *this and rhs refer to the same object.
   2) Checks whether *this and rhs do not refer to the same object.
   3) Orders *this and rhs by the order of this and &rhs. Equivalent to std::less<const
   error_category*>()(this, &rhs).

.SH Parameters

   code      - specifies the error code to compare
   condition - specifies the error condition to compare

.SH Return value

   1) true if *this and rhs refer to the same object, false otherwise.
   2) true if *this and rhs do not refer to the same object, false otherwise.
   3) true if *this is less than rhs as defined by the order of this and &rhs.
