.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <regex>
   template<

       class BidirIt,                                         \fI(since C++11)\fP
       class Alloc = std::allocator<std::sub_match<BidirIt>>

   > class match_results;

   The class template std::match_results holds a collection of character sequences that
   represent the result of a regular expression match.

   This is a specialized allocator-aware container. It can only be default created,
   obtained from std::regex_iterator, or modified by std::regex_search or
   std::regex_match. Because std::match_results holds std::sub_matches, each of which
   is a pair of iterators into the original character sequence that was matched, it's
   undefined behavior to examine std::match_results if the original character sequence
   was destroyed or iterators to it were invalidated for other reasons.

   The first sub_match (index 0) contained in a match_result always represents the full
   match within a target sequence made by a regex, and subsequent sub_matches represent
   sub-expression matches corresponding in sequence to the left parenthesis delimiting
   the sub-expression in the regex.

.SH Type requirements

   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of BidirectionalIterator.
   -
   Alloc must meet the requirements of Allocator.
