.SH Synopsis
   stack<T, Container>&                          \fB(1)\fP

   stack<T, Container>&                          \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   operator=( stack<T,Container>&& other );

   Replaces the contents of the container adaptor with those of other.

   1) Copy assignment operator. Replaces the contents with a copy of the contents of
   other. Effectively calls c = other.c;. (implicitly declared)
   2) Move assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other using move
   semantics. Effectively calls c = std::move(other.c); (implicitly declared)
