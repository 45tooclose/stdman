std::unordered_set::emplace \- std::unordered_set::emplace

.SH Synopsis
   template< class... Args >                            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::pair<iterator,bool> emplace( Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element into the container by constructing it in-place with the given
   args.

   Careful use of emplace allows the new element to be constructed while avoiding
   unnecessary copy or move operations. The constructor of the new element is called
   with exactly the same arguments as supplied to emplace, forwarded via
   std::forward<Args>(args)....

   If rehashing occurs due to the insertion, all iterators are invalidated. Otherwise
   iterators are not affected. References are not invalidated. Rehashing occurs only if
   the new number of elements is equal to or greater than
   max_load_factor()*bucket_count().

.SH Parameters

   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   Returns a pair consisting of a bool denoting whether the insertion took place and an
   iterator to the inserted element, or the already-existing element if no insertion
   happened.

.SH Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown by any operation, this function has no effect.

.SH Complexity

   Amortized constant on average, worst case linear in the size of the container.
