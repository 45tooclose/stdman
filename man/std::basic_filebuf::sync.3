.TH std::basic_filebuf::sync 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   virtual int sync()

   If a put area exists (e.g. the file was opened for writing), calls overflow() to
   write all pending output to the file.

   If a get area exists (e.g. the file was opened for reading), the effect is
   implementation-defined. Typical implementation may empty out the get area and move
   the current file position back by the corresponding number of bytes.
