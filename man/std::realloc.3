.SH NAME
std::realloc \- std::realloc

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   void* realloc( void* ptr, std::size_t new_size );

   Reallocates the given area of memory. It must be previously allocated by
   std::malloc(), std::calloc() or std::realloc() and not yet freed with std::free(),
   otherwise, the results are undefined.

   The reallocation is done by either:

   a) expanding or contracting the existing area pointed to by ptr, if possible. The
   contents of the area remain unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old sizes. If
   the area is expanded, the contents of the new part of the array are undefined.
   b) allocating a new memory block of size new_size bytes, copying memory area with
   size equal the lesser of the new and the old sizes, and freeing the old block.

   If there is not enough memory, the old memory block is not freed and null-pointer is
   returned.

   If ptr is NULL, the behavior is the same as calling std::malloc(new_size).

   If new_size is zero, the behavior is implementation defined (null pointer may be
   returned, or some non-null pointer may be returned that may not be used to access
   storage).

.SH Notes

   Because reallocation may involve bytewise copying (regardless of whether it's to
   expand or to contract), only the objects of TriviallyCopyable types are safe to
   access in the preserved part of the memory block after a call to realloc.

.SH Parameters

   ptr      - pointer to the memory area to be reallocated
   new_size - new size of the array

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the beginning of newly allocated memory or NULL if error has occurred.
   The pointer must be deallocated with std::free().
