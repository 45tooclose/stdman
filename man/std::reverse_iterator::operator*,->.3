.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Reference or pointer to the element previous to current.

.SH Notes

   The iterator object contains an auxiliary member variable d_tmp, not a temporary
   variable, to avoid returning a reference that persists beyond the lifetime of its
   associated iterator.
