.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <list>
   template<

       class T,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<T>

   > class list;

   std::list is a container that supports constant time insertion and removal of
   elements from anywhere in the container. Fast random access is not supported. It is
   usually implemented as double-linked list. Compared to std::forward_list this
   container provides bidirectional iteration capability while being less space
   efficient.

   Addition, removal and moving the elements within the list or across several lists
   does not invalidate the iterators. An iterator is invalidated only when the
   corresponding element is deleted.

   std::list meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   SequenceContainer and ReversibleContainer.

.SH Template parameters

               The type of the elements.

               T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable and         \fI(until C++11)\fP
               CopyConstructible.
               The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend
   T         - on the actual operations performed on the container.
               Generally, it is required that element type meets the      \fI(since C++11)\fP
               requirements of MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable, but
               many member functions impose stricter requirements.

               
   Allocator - An allocator that is used to acquire memory to store the elements. The
               type must meet the requirements of Allocator.
