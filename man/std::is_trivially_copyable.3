.TH std::is_trivially_copyable 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <type_traits>
   template< class T >              \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_trivially_copyable;

   If T is a trivially copyable type, provides the member constant value equal true.
   For any other type, value is false.

   The only trivially copyable types are scalar types, trivially copyable classes, and
   arrays of such types/classes (possibly cv-qualified).

   A trivially copyable class is a class that

   1. Has no non-trivial copy constructors (this also requires no virtual functions or
   virtual bases)

   2. Has no non-trivial move constructors

   3. Has no non-trivial copy assignment operators

   4. Has no non-trivial move assignment operators

   5. Has a trivial destructor

.SH Notes

   Objects of trivially-copyable types are the only C++ objects that may be safely
   copied with std::memcpy or serialized to/from binary files with
   std::ofstream::write()/std::ifstream::read(). In general, a trivially copyable type
   is any type for which the underlying bytes can be copied to an array of char or
   unsigned char and into a new object of the same type, and the resulting object would
   have the same value as the original.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <type_traits>
  
 struct A {
     int m;
 };
  
 struct B {
     B(const B&) {}
 };
  
 struct C {
     virtual void foo();
 };
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << std::boolalpha;
     std::cout << std::is_trivially_copyable<A>::value << '\\n';
     std::cout << std::is_trivially_copyable<B>::value << '\\n';
     std::cout << std::is_trivially_copyable<C>::value << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 true
 false
 false
