.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template<class Codecvt,

   class Elem = wchar_t,                                          \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class Tr = std::char_traits<Elem> >

   class wbuffer_convert : public std::basic_streambuf<Elem, Tr>

   std::wbuffer_convert is a wrapper over stream buffer of type
   std::basic_streambuf<char> which gives it the appearance of
   std::basic_streambuf<Elem>. All I/O performed through std::wbuffer_convert undergoes
   character conversion as defined by the facet Codecvt. std::wbuffer_convert assumes
   ownership of the conversion facet, and cannot use a facet managed by a locale. The
   standard facets suitable for use with std::wbuffer_convert are std::codecvt_utf8 for
   UTF-8/UCS2 and UTF-8/UCS4 conversions and std::codecvt_utf8_utf16 for UTF-8/UTF-16
   conversions.

   This class template makes the implicit character conversion functionality of
   std::basic_filebuf available for any std::basic_streambuf.
