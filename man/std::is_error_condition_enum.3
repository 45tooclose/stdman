.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <system_error>
   template< class T >               \fI(since C++11)\fP
   struct is_error_condition_enum;

   If T is an error condition enum, this template provides the member constant value
   equal true. For any other type, value is false.

   This template may be specialized for a user-defined type to indicate that the type
   is eligible for std::error_code and std::error_condition automatic conversions.

   The following class of the standard library is an error condition enum: std::errc.
