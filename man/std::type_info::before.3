.SH Synopsis
   bool before( const type_info& rhs );

   Returns true if the referred type precedes type, referred to by rhs in the
   implementation's collation order. No guarantees are given, in particular, the
   collation order can change between the invocations of the same program.

.SH Parameters

   rhs - another type information object to compare to

.SH Return value

   true if the referred type precedes type, referred to by rhs in the implementation's
   collation order.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <typeinfo>

 int main()
 {
   if(typeid(int).before(typeid(char)))
     std::cout << "int goes before char in this implementation.\\n";
   else
     std::cout << "char goes before int in this implementation.\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 char goes before int in this implementation.
