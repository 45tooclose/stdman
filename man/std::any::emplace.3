.SH Synopsis
   template< class T, class... Args >                           \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   void emplace( Args&&... args );
   template< class T, class U, class... Args >                  \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   void emplace( std::initializer_list<U> il, Args&&... args );

   Changes the contained object to one of type T constructed from the arguments.

   First destroys the current contained object (if any) by reset(), then:

   1) constructs an object of type T, direct-non-list-initialized from
   std::forward<Args>(args)..., as the contained object. If std::is_constructible_v<T,
   Args...> is false, the behavior is undefined.
   2) constructs an object of type T, direct-non-list-initialized from il,
   std::forward<Args>(args)..., as the contained object. This overload only
   participates in overload resolution if std::is_constructible_v<T,
   std::initializer_list<U>&, Args...> is true.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws any exception thrown by T's constructor. If an exception is thrown, the
   previously contained object (if any) has been destroyed, and *this does not contain
   a value.
