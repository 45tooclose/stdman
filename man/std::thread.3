.TH std::thread 3 "Jun 28 2014" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <thread>
   class thread;               \fI(since C++11)\fP

   The class thread represents a single thread of execution. Threads allow multiple
   pieces of code to run asynchronously and simultaneously.

.SH Member types

   Member type        Definition
   native_handle_type implementation-defined

.SH Member classes

   id represents the id of a thread
      \fI(public member class)\fP 

.SH Member functions

   constructor          constructs new thread object
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 
                        destructs the thread object, underlying thread must be joined
   destructor           or detached
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator=            moves the thread object
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 
.SH Observers
                        checks whether the thread is joinable, i.e. potentially running
   joinable             in parallel context
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 
   get_id               returns the id of the thread
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 
   native_handle        returns the underlying implementation-defined thread handle
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 
   hardware_concurrency returns the number of concurrent threads supported by the
   \fB[static]\fP             implementation
                        \fI(public static member function)\fP 
.SH Operations
   join                 waits for a thread to finish its execution
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 
                        permits the thread to execute independently from the thread
   detach               handle
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 
   swap                 swaps two thread objects
                        \fI(public member function)\fP 

.SH Non-member functions

   std::swap(std::thread) specializes the std::swap algorithm
   \fI(C++11)\fP                \fI(function template)\fP
