.TH std::forward_list::swap 3 "Sep  4 2015" "2.0 | http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   void swap( forward_list& other );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Exchanges the contents of the container with those of other. Does not invoke any
   move, copy, or swap operations on individual elements.

   All iterators and references remain valid. It is unspecified whether an iterator
   holding the past-the-end value in this container will refer to the this or the other
   container after the operation.

   If std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap::value
   is true, then the allocators are exchanged using an unqualified call to       (since
   non-member swap. Otherwise, they are not swapped (and if get_allocator() !=   C++11)
   other.get_allocator(), the behavior is undefined).
