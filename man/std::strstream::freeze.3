.TH std::strstream::freeze 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   void freeze(bool flag = true);

   If the stream is using a dynamically-allocated array for output, disables (flag ==
   true) or enables (flag == false) automatic allocation/deallocation of the buffer.
   Effectively calls rdbuf()->pcount()

.SH Notes

   After a call to str(), dynamic streams become frozen automatically. A call to
   freeze(false) is required before exiting the scope in which this strstream object
   was created. otherwise the destructor will leak memory. Also, additional output to a
   frozen stream may be truncated once it reaches the end of the allocated buffer.

.SH Parameters

   flag - desired status

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <strstream>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     std::strstream dyn; // dynamically-allocated output buffer
     dyn << "Test: " << 1.23;
     std::cout << "The output stream contains \\"" << dyn.str() << "\\"\\n";

     dyn << "Test: " << 1.23;
     std::cout << "The output stream contains \\"" << dyn.str() << "\\"\\n";
     // the stream is now frozen due to str()
     dyn << " More text";
     std::cout << "The output stream contains \\"" << dyn.str() << "\\"\\n";
     dyn.freeze(false);
 }

.SH Possible output:

 The output stream contains "Test: 1.23"
 The output stream contains "Test: 1.23 More "
