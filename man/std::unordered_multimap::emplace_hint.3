.TH std::unordered_multimap::emplace_hint 3 "Apr 19 2014" "1.0.0" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH Synopsis
   template <class... Args>                                       \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args );

   Inserts a new element to the container, using hint as a suggestion where the element
   should go. The element is constructed in-place, i.e. no copy or move operations are
   performed.

   The constructor of the element type (value_type, that is, std::pair<const Key, T>)
   is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function, forwarded
   with std::forward<Args>(args)....

   If rehashing occurs due to the insertion, all iterators are invalidated. Otherwise
   iterators are not affected. References are not invalidated. Rehashing occurs only if
   the new number of elements is equal to or greater than
   max_load_factor()*bucket_count().

.SH Parameters

   hint - iterator, used as a suggestion as to where to insert the new element
   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

.SH Return value

   Returns an iterator to the newly inserted element.

.SH Complexity

   Amortized constant on average, worst case linear in the size of the container.
