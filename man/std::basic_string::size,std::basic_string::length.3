.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The number of CharT elements in the string.

.SH Exceptions

   \fI(none)\fP                    \fI(until C++11)\fP
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
     

.SH Complexity

   Constant

.SH Notes

   For std::string, the elements are bytes (objects of type char), which are not the
   same as characters if a multibyte encoding such as UTF-8 is used.
