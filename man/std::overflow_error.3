std::overflow_error \- std::overflow_error

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class overflow_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that arise
   because integer value in some computation could not be represented as it had too
   large positive value. If the value has floating point type, std::range_error should
   be used.
